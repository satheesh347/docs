# **Waves Streaming Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

- Waves Streaming TTS lets you convert text into speech **in real time** using a WebSocket connection.
- The API streams **audio chunks** instantly, making it ideal for assistants, chatbots, and interactive voice apps.
- It provides **low latency** audio generation, so your application can speak back instantly while text is still being sent.

## **🔗 Endpoint**

- This is the WebSocket URL where you connect to start receiving streamed audio.

```
wss://api.smallest.ai/v4/tts/stream
```

## **Required Headers**

- Headers are **extra information** you send along with your API request so the server can understand who you are and what you want.

These headers must be included during the WebSocket upgrade request :

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

## **JavaScript Example**

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket("wss://api.smallest.ai/v4/tts/stream", {
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
});

socket.onopen = () => {
  socket.send(JSON.stringify({
    text: "Hello! This is Waves Streaming TTS.",
    voice: "nova",
    format: "wav"
  }));
};

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  // Each message is an audio chunk
  console.log("Audio chunk received:", event.data);
};

socket.onclose = () => console.log("Stream ended");
```

## **Sample Streaming Response**

```javascript
{
  "type": "audio_chunk",
  "data": "<base64-audio>"
}
```

Final message :

```javascript
{
  "type": "end_of_stream"
}
```

## **💡Tip**

For smooth playback, configure your WebSocket client to handle **binary data (**`ArrayBuffer`**)** instead of plain text Waves streams raw audio frames.
